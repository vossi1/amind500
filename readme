256 bytes C64 zeropage demo from Linus Akesson Rev. 2017
converted to P500 by vossi 05/2020

assembling: acme amind500.b

amind500.b
- loaded in bank 0, copied to zp bank 15 and started there
- char rom on P500 not movable in bank15 -> fixed charset
- vic-area not moveable to $0000-$3fff -> used at standard $d000
- reset after test does not work
- irq runs with psu frequency -> demo runs slower with 50Hz in the EU

amind500b0.b
- runs in bank 0 directly
- because of basic loader it needs additional space at $200 behind the stack
- ^ in the P500 it's not possible to start machine code with SY in bank 0 !
- some more instructions needed for indirect access to bank 15 I/O
- because of no kernal-sub available it runs with own irq handler in bank 0
- runs with vic raster-irq -> 60Hz on 6567 US machine, 50Hz on 6569 EU P500
- problems with reading SID envelope reg $1c -> graphics not like C64 version
